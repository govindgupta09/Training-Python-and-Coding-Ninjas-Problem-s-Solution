# Write a program to input an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.

## Note : For printing multiple values in one line, put them inside print separated by space.
## You can follow this syntax for printing values of two variables val1 and val2 separaetd by space -
## print(val1, " ", val2)


n = int(input())
esum = 0
osum = 0
while(n>0):
    dig = n%10
    n = n//10
    if dig%2==0:
        esum=esum+dig
    else:
        osum = osum+dig
print(esum,'',osum)
